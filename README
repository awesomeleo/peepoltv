TODO:

- validations for video submissions
	- check that embed codes are actually embed codes (regex?)
- search by lat/lon
- add map, click to initiate AJAX search from that lat/lon
- admin/banning
- distinguish between live streams and non-live (How?)
- make pretty
- "add to viewer" for videos so you can start watching some of them in a "tray"
